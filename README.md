## What is deliberate practice?

Deliberate practice is a structured and goal-driven approach to improvement. Unlike routine practice, which may involve passive repetition, 
deliberate practice demands focused effort, intentional strategy, and continuous refinement to enhance performance.

The Deliberate Practice Tracker App was designed to help me apply this method by setting "SMART"(specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timebound) goals, maintaining focus, and tracking progress

## How does the app WORK?
There are three modes, 
1. Setting goals
2. Focusing, and achieving set goals
3. Reflecting and improving upon practice 

**GOAL SETTING MODE**

In this mode, users set "SMART" goals to focus on through breaking down goals into smaller, actionable steps.

**FOCUS MODE**
Users focus on achieving their "SMART" goal within a time limit.

**Additional features**

  - **Problem Solving:** To make achieving goals easier, users can break down complex problems into smaller, actionable chunks, helping to tackle challenges systematically.
  
  - **Distraction Logging:** Allows users to note distractions, either to observe patterns or log them for later entertainment, ensuring they stay focused during practice.

**REFLECTION MODE**
Users can finally rest, as well as reflect on their performance to make observations on how the practice went.

### Data Logging and Analysis
All session data is automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API where data is saved on the cloud allowing users to log in data from different computers.
Users can then track performance and identify trends to improve their practice for better results.

This project began as part of a 4-week "Introduction to Python" course and was later expanded due to the benefits it brang to my practices.
