## Have you ever done a task over and over and over again, but never quite seem to improve?

Introducing the deliberate practice timer!

Deliberate practice is a method for practicing that involves setting clear goals, practicing, then obtaining feedback to improve ones own practice.
This allows users to deliberately target areas of improvements.

Contrast that with mindless practice which involves passive repetition that relies on practictioners to improve automatically through mindlessly practicing
often yielding growth that tapers off as they continue practicing(logarithmic growth)

## How does the app WORK?
There are three modes, that are cycled through
1. Setting "SMART" goals
2. Focusing, and achieving set goals
3. Reflecting and improving upon practice 

**GOAL SETTING MODE**

In this mode, users set "SMART" goals to focus on through breaking down goals into smaller, actionable steps.

**FOCUS MODE**

Users focus on achieving their "SMART" goal within a time limit.

**Additional features**

  - **Problem Solving:** To make achieving goals easier, users can break down complex problems into smaller, actionable chunks, helping to tackle challenges systematically.
  
  - **Distraction Logging:** Allows users to note distractions, either to observe patterns or log them for later entertainment, ensuring they stay focused during practice.

**REFLECTION MODE**

Users can finally rest, as well as reflect on their performance to make observations on how the practice went.

### Data Logging and Analysis
All session data is automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API where data is saved on the cloud allowing users to log in data from different computers.
Users can then track performance and identify trends to improve their practice for better results. In addition to this, all the data will be filtered weekly and automatically sent to CHATGPT where it will send me a weekly summary on what I did that week for accountability and further analysis of my practice trends.

This project began as part of a 4-week "Introduction to Python" course and was later expanded due to the benefits it brang to my practices.
