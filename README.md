## What is deliberate practice?

Deliberate practice is a way of practicing that seeks to achieve consistent performance increases through
focused, goal-oriented practice that targets specific weaknesses, incorporates immediate feedback, and pushing comfort zones.

**Deliberate Practice Tracker App**
Purpose: This app seeks to aid users in applying deliberate practice by creating a platform to easily label specific tasks they are performing, providing immediate feedback, while saving the data
for the future to allow users to easil define trends in their practice.

All data is then automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API for me to find patterns in behaviour to improve upon practice

Key Features:

**Goal Setting**: Users can define clear objectives for each practice period, ensuring each session is purpose-driven.

**Feedback Mechanism**: After each session, the app prompts users to reflect and record what was learned and identify areas for further improvement, reinforcing the learning process.

**Focus Enhancer**: An optional Tick-Tock sound feature can be activated to help maintain concentration throughout the session.

**Time Logging**: A straightforward start/stop timer helps track the duration of each practice session.

**Distraction Logging**: Users can log instances of distractions while focusing, allowing attention to be diverted back to task while understanding patterns in behaviour.






This project began as part of a 4-week "Introduction to Python" course and was later expanded due to the benefits it brang to my practices. 
CHATGPT was extensively used in the making of this project to decrease development time
