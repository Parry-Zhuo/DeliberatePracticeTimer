Key Features:

**Goal Setting**: Users can define clear objectives for each practice period, ensuring each session is purpose-driven.

**Feedback Mechanism**: After each session, the app prompts users to reflect and record what was learned and identify areas for further improvement, reinforcing the learning process.

**Focus Enhancer**: An optional Tick-Tock sound feature can be activated to help maintain concentration throughout the session.

**Time Logging**: A straightforward start/stop timer helps track the duration of each practice session.

**Distraction Logging**: Users can log instances of distractions, to better understand and manage their focus.



All data is automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API, ensuring seamless cloud connectivity.
