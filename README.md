## What is deliberate practice?

Deliberate practice is a way of practicing that seeks to achieve consistent performance increases through
focused, goal-oriented practice that targets specific weaknesses, incorporates immediate feedback, and pushing comfort zones.

**Deliberate Practice Tracker App**

This app seeks to aid users in applying deliberate practice by creating a platform to easily label specific tasks they are performing, providing immediate feedback, while automatically saving the data to allow
users to identify areas of improvement.

## How does the app WORK?
There are three modes, 
1. Setting goals
2. Focusing, and achieving set goals
3. Reflecting and improving upon practice 

**GOAL SETTING MODE**

In this mode, users set SMART(specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timebound) goals to focus on through breaking down goals into smaller, actionable steps.

**FOCUS MODE**
Users focus on achieving their SMART goal within a time limit.

**Additional features to aid in focusing**

  - **Problem Solving:** To make achieving goals easier, users can break down complex problems into smaller, actionable chunks, helping to tackle challenges systematically.
  
  - **Distraction Logging:** Allows users to note distractions, either to observe patterns or log them for later entertainment, ensuring they stay focused during practice.

**REFLECTION MODE**
Users can finally rest, as well as reflect on their performance to make observations on how the practice went.

### Data Logging and Analysis
All session data is automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API. Allowing users to track performance 
over time and identify trends and adjust their practice for better results

This project began as part of a 4-week "Introduction to Python" course and was later expanded due to the benefits it brang to my practices. 
CHATGPT was extensively used in the making of this project to decrease development time
